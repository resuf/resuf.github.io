The role of affirmative action policies in promoting socio-economic mobility remains a subject of intense global debate, with countries implementing varying strategies to address historical inequalities. This study leverages India's 2008 delimitation exercise as a natural experiment to assess the impact of political quotas for Scheduled Castes (SCs) on local socio-economic outcomes, focusing specifically on SC outcomes within villages rather than solely village-level metrics. We find that SC reservations substantially increase SC student enrollment, particularly in prestigious schools, and foster entrepreneurial activity, as evidenced by growth in both the number and size of SC-owned firms. Additionally, quotas facilitate SCs' entry into higher-status occupations, helping to erode entrenched caste-based occupational barriers. These effects are driven by greater access to formal institutional funding for SC-owned firms and improvements in the quality of politicians elected under the quota system. Improvements at the village level, including infrastructure enhancements and increased economic activity, further support these outcomes. Notably, the observed gains persist even after villages lose reserved status, underscoring the long-term benefits of these policies. Our findings contribute to global discourse on affirmative action, suggesting that targeted, well-implemented quotas can yield sustained social and economic mobility for marginalized groups. With India's next delimitation scheduled post-2026, this research provides critical insights for policymakers worldwide who are seeking effective strategies to address inequality and social stratification.

The growing prominence of Hindu nationalism, known as "Hindutva," in India has garnered significant attention for its impact on politics and society, particularly its adverse effects on minority communities. However, the Hindu identity was not always a monolithic and political one. This study explores the potential role of a Hindu mythological show, "Ramayana," which aired on the solely available TV channel in India during 1987-88, in shaping the Hindutva identity primarily on the increasing salience of religious identity in people's political, social, and personal lives. We proxy for exposure to this show using location and television transmitters obtained from archival data and use signal propagation modelling based on irregular terrain to measure signal strength. Examining political and social manifestations of identity, we find that exposure to the TV show is associated with increased electoral success for right-wing Hindu nationalist parties, heightened tensions between Hindus and Muslims, and a decrease in the number of schools affiliated with the significant far-right Hindu nationalist organization. Our next steps involve investigating the impact on personal expressions of identity, such as child naming practices and dietary choices influenced by religious taboos.</div>

Opposition parties across contexts have struggled against populist parties at the ballot box. Populist parties often brand the opposition as elite and out of touch with citizens. Over time, as populists erode democracy, they can further tilt electoral politics in their direction. How can the opposition respond? We examine the opposition's use of leader-driven grassroots campaigns as an electoral strategy against populists. These campaigns directly address the unique weaknesses that the opposition faces against populists by reaching voters directly and improving the party's image. We analyze the electoral impact of these efforts by studying the Indian National Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's 150-day grassroots march, the Bharat Jodo Yatra. Using newly collected state and national election data and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the yatra improved Congress's electoral performance; however, in a spatially and temporally limited way. An original phone survey of 3500 voters reveals that those who directly participated in the grassroots campaign experienced longer-term positive impacts. Taken together, the findings reveal the promise and limitations of leader-driven grassroots campaigns as an opposition strategy against a backsliding populist party.

[Digitizing Justice: Trickle-up effects of Indonesian E-Courts Reform](), (with [Sultan Mehmood](https://sites.google.com/view/sultan-mehmood/home) and [Thomas Fujiwara](https://sites.google.com/view/tfujiwara/home))

The growing adoption of digital justice reforms worldwide represents a significant shift in how judicial systems operate. By streamlining processes, enhancing transparency, and improving access, these reforms promise to address longstanding inefficiencies within court systems. However, the impacts of digitalization are not uniform, and questions remain regarding disparities in access, the adaptability of legal practitioners, and the broader implications for case management and judicial independence. Exploring how digital justice reforms shape court efficiency and procedural fairness is essential to understanding their transformative potential. To answer these questions, we investigate the impact of Indonesia's E-Court Reform, a digitization initiative aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency by implementing electronic filing, summons, and trial processes in civil courts. Using a triple difference empirical strategy, we analyze the universe of Indonesian court cases to measure effects on case processing times, quality of judicial decisions, and broader systemic impacts on untreated courts. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in case delays by approximately 7.3 days, with no decline in decision quality; metrics like legal reasoning per page have improved, so do fewer cases proceed to appeal or are overturned at higher court. These efficiency gains are concentrated in straightforward cases, thereby freeing judicial resources for more complex cases. We also document positive spillovers to higher courts, where delays have also decreased, indicating a “trickle-up” effect of digital reform across the judiciary. This study contributes novel causal evidence on digital reform efficacy in judicial systems, demonstrating that digitization can reduce procedural bottlenecks and improve overall case management quality in large, developing country contexts.
