I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford's King Center on Global Development](https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/postdoctoral-fellows) at Stanford University.

My research broadly focuses on the political economy of minorities in the Indian context.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from HEC Lausanne, University of Lausanne, where I was supervised by Dominic Rohner and Ekaterina Zhuravskaya. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned an M.Res. in Economics from the Paris School of Economics and a B.A. (Honours) in Economics from the University of Delhi.
