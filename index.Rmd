I am a 5th-year PhD Candidate in Economics at the [HEC Lausanne, University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home.html).

My research broadly relates to the **political economy of minorities** in the Indian context. 

Prior to this, I earned my M.Res. in Economics at the Paris School of Economics. I did my B.A Economics (with honours) at the University of Delhi. I am supervised by [Dominic Rohner](https://sites.google.com/site/dprohner/) and [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/).

I visited Stanford University from January 2023 to June 2023. I also visited the Paris School of Economics (January 2024 to August 2024)
