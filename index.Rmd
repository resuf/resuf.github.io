I am a 5th-year PhD Candidate in Economics at the [HEC Lausanne, University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home.html).

My research broadly relates to the development and political economics in the Indian context.

Prior to this, I earned my M.Res. in Economics at the Paris School of Economics. I did my B.A Economics (with Honours) at the University of Delhi. I am supervised by Dominic Rohner and Ekaterina Zhuravskaya.

I visited Stanford University from January 2023 to May 2023. I also visited the Paris School of Economics (January 2024 to August 2024)
