I will join Stanford's King Center on Global Development [Stanford's King Center on Global Development](https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/postdoctoral-fellows) as Postdoctoral Fellow in January 2026.

I received my PhD in Economics from [HEC Lausanne, University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home.html) supervised by Dominic Rohner and Ekaterina Zhuravskaya.. My research broadly relates to the **political economy of minorities** in the Indian context.

Prior to this, I earned my M.Res. in Economics at the Paris School of Economics. I did my B.A Economics (with honours) at the University of Delhi.
